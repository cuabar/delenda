		<h2>Backstory</h2>
		<p>After several decades colonising and expanding within the solar system, mankind found themselves running out of adequate living space. Without the engineering ability to build large scale artifical habitats,
		humanity was forced to find other ways of solving the overpopulation problem. In the year 2455, scientists in the United States of America (by this stage incorporating Mexico and large parts of South America) developed a successful prototype of a wormhole drive, for the first time
		allowing humanity to break the light speed limit and expand into the galaxy without the need for costly and unreliable generational ships. With their living space problems solved, 
		billions of humans left the solar system to seek out a new life in the galaxy. Terraforming and biodome technologies allowed humanity to colonise all but the most hostile worlds and moons, and by the year 2600
		humanity's population surpassed the 80 billion mark, with colonies and new nations sprouting up all across the near one hundred colonised systems in humanity's domain. Although barely a speck when compared to the enormous
		size of the galaxy, the area of space controlled by the human species offered more than enough resources to preserve humanity well into the future.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>The Superpowers</h3>
		<p>Despite now being a disparate collection of solar systems, with hundreds of new worlds developing cultures and nations of their own, it was the aged and powerful superpowers of Earth which were the unquestionable might of the human controlled sectors of the galaxy.
		The United States, which had joined with the British Commonwealth after the near collapse of the European Union in 2030, was the premier power among the stars. Its privatised space program fuelled massive expansion, giving it riches beyond any other superpower as corporate sponsors developed
		huge mining colonies across US and British controlled space, eventually forming a single unified body of power to streamline its expansion and growing trade empire in the Mercantile Union.</p> <br>
		<p>The Russian space program had partnered with the Chinese early in the colonisation of the Solar System. Both nations were eager to surpass the success of the US, and with the well developed Russian space program being funded by the immensely wealthy
		People's Republic, they formed the next power bloc in the space race. In fact, so successful were they that the number of colonies controlled by the Solidarity Pact soon outnumbered even that of the
		Mercantile Union although this left their colonies poorly developed by comparison.</p><br>
		<p>The third and final power lay meekly back in the heart of humanity. With the Union and the Solidarity having long since abandoned humanity's two major population centres (the Sol and Alpha Centauri systems) for their own territory, the European Federation grabbed at what had been abandoned and ignored.
		Never having been able to catch up with the growth of the other nations of Earth after their near collapse, the people of Europe had similarly fallen behind in the space race. Instead they sought to fully develop the small number of systems they <i>did</i>
		control and the European Federation rapidly became a densely populated civilisation controlling a mere two solar systems, while simultaneously becoming a beacon of technological progress and research.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>The Collapse of Humanity</h3>
		<p>In the year 2680, humanity was dealt a severe blow. Although the majority of their populations were in their own respective territories, both the Union and the Solidarity still had some marked presence near the Sol systems.
		Large parts of the governments of the constituent nations of these powers were still located here. So when Sol, Alpha Centauri and two other systems were suddenly and inexplicably silenced, both the Solidarity and the Union found
		large parts of their command structures missing. Chaos reigned across human space, and both the Union and the Solidarity were forced to instigate martial law, transferring whatever powers the individual national governments had once held
		to the controlling powers of each supernation (the Board of Directors for the Union, and the Chiefs of Staff for the Solidarity). As was expected, several of the core worlds refused to accept the rule of either of these superpowers, resisting all attempts
		to bring them into either sphere of influence. Instead these core worlds formed a series of loose and confusing treaties with one another for security. Efforts to examine what had happened to Sol and Alpha Centauri all returned nothing.
		Neither superpower was willing to risk losing control over its constituents in the event the original government leaders were found alive and well, and the core worlds did not have the infrastructure to both
		defend against the two superpowers <i>and</i> send forces to explore and possibly reclaim Alpha Centauri and Sol. Over time, the systems were forgotten. No signals nor ships came from any of the silent star systems, and history wrote the European Federation
		as having finally collapsed, possibly into civil war, taking the core of humanity with it.</p><br>
		<p>The next half century of history was frought with violence. The core world survivors fought desperately to maintain their independence, and the two Superpowers fought to a bitter stalemate to secure themselves as the rightful ruler
		of humanity. The Solidarity, with its massive population and powerful industry smashed itself against the more developed and resilient systems of the Union. Neither side was willing to relent, and while they could have easily 
		overrun the core worlds to gain more territory, doing so would have weakened their position against each other. Over time, the war ground down to nothing, and both sides settled into a stalemate.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>The Authority</h3>
		<p>So intent were both sides on watching one another, neither noticed as one by one the core world survivors were approached by a single national entity. Beginning in 2750, one by one the core worlds were engulfed,
		sometimes by diplomacy and sometimes by violence. It was only when this new power approached the outer colonies of the two superpowers that they took notice. Calling itself the Origin Authority, it claimed to be
		the descendants of the European Federation, and as the nation in control of Sol they wished to reunite humanity under one banner. Although the Authority diplomats swore they would not assert complete dominance over either nation,
		and that individual colonies would remain untouched, their demands of tribute and command of each side's military angered the controlling powers of each faction. Suspicious of their supposed kindness, both the Union and the Solidarity rejected the
		Authority's offers. The diplomats left for Authority space, and the superpowers returned to their cold war.</p><br>
		<p>The Authority was not to be denied, and a sudden vicious assault on both superpowers left them reeling. System after system found itself under assault from the ruthless Authority armies, entire cities levelled and civilian populations subjugated
		by the Authority's forces, all in the name of making a "better" galaxy for humanity. The technology of the Authority far outmatched anything the other sides could develop, it was only through attrition in the case of the Union and sheer numbers in the case of the Solidarity
		which stalled the Authority's advance. Fortunately, so advanced were the Authority's war machines that recovering their losses was time consuming. But the Authority was manipulative, and incited rebellion on enemy worlds with its promise of a human utopia.
		While it could not be doubted that the Authority <i>could</i> offer a better standard of living to humanity, the cost of doing so was total subservience. Baseline humans had next to no rights compared to the cyborgs and uploaded minds which made up the core of the Authority's population.
		Unwilling to bow down and submit to such an uneven society, and able to see beyond the shining facade which it presented to the civilian population, both governments turned to fight the Authority.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>An Age of War</h3>
		<p>But decades of animosity are not easily overcome, even against an aggressor like the Origin Authority. Only a few years into the war, the Mercantile Union sought to take advantage of the exposed flanks of the Solidarity. Underestimating their foe, they launched a surprise attack against Solidarity worlds on
		their border. Their success was quick, but short lived, as the Solidarity drew up millions of conscripts and rolled over the Mercantiles in a tide of bodies. Soon after the war between these two was reignited, the Authority began another assault
		on both, eager to use the confusion and distraction to its advantage.</p><br>
		<p>It is now 2800, and the war is entering its tenth year. Take command as a General of the Union, Marshal of the Solidarity or Combat Intelligence of the Authority, raise your army to fight in the war, and gather supporters and workers to fund your efforts.<br>
		Good luck.</p>
